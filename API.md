# Broadcaster API documentation

## Topics (HTTP)

### GET /topics

Returns the available topics as a JSON array.

```
GET /topics
```

```json
200 OK
[
	{
		"id": "topic1",
		"description": "Example topic"
	},
	{
		"id": "topic2",
		"description": "Another example"
	}
]
```

### POST /topics

Creates a new topic, and returns the updated list of topics.

Request body should be JSON of a Topic object.

```json
POST /topics
{
	"id": "topic1",
	"description": "Example topic"
}
```

```json
200 OK
[
	{
		"id": "topic1",
		"description": "Example topic"
	},
	{
		"id": "topic2",
		"description": "Another example"
	}
]
```

### DELETE /topics

Deletes a topic, and returns the updated list of topics.

Request body should be JSON, with `id` being the ID of the topic you want to delete.

```json
DELETE /topics
{
	"id": "topic2"
}
```

```json
200 OK
[
	{
		"id": "topic1",
		"description": "Example topic"
	}
]
```

## Notify (HTTP)

### POST /notify

Sends a notification to a topic*, and returns the number of people notified.

Request body should be JSON, with `topic` being the ID of the topic you want to send to, and `content` being the content of the notification.

*It actually gets sent to everyone, since there's no mechanism to specify to the server what topics you're subscribed to. But the topic is specified in the message so the client can filter it out.

```json
POST /notify
{
	"topic": "topic1",
	"content": "Hello world!"
}
```

```json
200 OK
{
	"count": "727"
}
```

## Listen (WebSocket)

Connect to `/listen`. All messages should be in JSON and contain a `e` (stands for event) property saying what kind of message (from the below) it is.

### Server â†’ Client: new notification

Properties:
- `e` (event): `1` (`WebsocketEvent.NewNotification`)
- `t` (topic): the Topic ID of the notification 
	- (this could be a topic the client isn't aware of but does actually exist (i.e. got added later), so don't error if this is an unknown topic!)
- `c` (content): the content of the notification
	- 1000 character limit
